# TODO

- [-] Larger than mobile styling
- [ ] what is the point of /api/comments and /api/comments/[id] when comments are available under each drill down /api/events/[id]/comments? should comment api only be used for posting/editing/deleting comments from Comments component? is it used for listin right now?
- [ ] think of a way to expand linked button to be compatable with profile aside
