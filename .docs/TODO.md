## Comments

when entering empty comment and get Error: Comment cannot be empty all comments dissapear, error message should be separate and not affect existent comment list

editing comment didn't refresh it even on page that seemed to refreshed. had to do manual refresh to see it

takes a while sometimes until new comments appear, is it due to cache in api?

### Result

appears to be due to cache

## Events

when adding new event it should appear at the top of the list?

## Notices

when adding new notice no success message appears in /notices after it's been added, should probably be toaster

## Homepage

Upcoming events sized wrong on mobile, why? padding in .event-info responsible
