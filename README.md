### II. Technical Considerations

* **Platform Choice:**
  * **WordPress with Plugins:** Good for quick deployment, extensive plugin ecosystem for events, news, and lost/found. Markdown can be integrated via plugins or custom fields. Requires regular maintenance.
  * **Custom Web Application (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, Node.js):** Offers maximum flexibility and scalability, but requires more development time and expertise.
  * **Static Site Generator (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll) with Headless CMS:** Good for performance and security, but less dynamic for user-generated content unless integrated with a backend for submissions.

* **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store events, posts, user data.

* **Markdown Rendering:** Implement a Markdown parser on the frontend (e.g., `marked.js` for JavaScript) and ensure secure rendering on the backend to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

* **Image Handling:** Secure image upload and storage. Optimize images for web.

* **Security:** Implement SSL, input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS).

* **Responsive Design:** The website must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
